#SASS and CSS
We use SASS and Bourbon (http://bourbon.io/) for our resources. If you don't use SASS, just use
the .css files that you find in the css folder. You can delete both sass and partials folders.! !
We have integrated Meyerweb CSS reset rules (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and
Modernizr (http://modernizr.com/).
